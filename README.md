# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game project! This classic memory game, originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, has stood the test of time as a challenging yet fun way to test and improve your memory skills. In this digital adaptation, players are presented with a sequence of colors and sounds, which they must then repeat in the same order. Sounds easy? Think again! As you progress, the sequences become longer and more complex, putting your memory to the ultimate test.

## How to Play Simon Game

Playing Simon Game is simple yet addictive:

1. Start the game by pressing the "Start" button.
2. Simon, the electronic device, will produce a sequence of tones and colors, which you must remember.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking or tapping on the corresponding colored buttons.
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, Simon will add another step to the sequence.
5. Keep following Simon's lead and replicating the sequences until your memory fails you.
6. If you make a mistake, Simon will let you know with a distinctive sound and light, and the game will end.

Challenge yourself to beat your previous high score and see how far you can go!

## About This Project

This Simon Game project was created using HTML5, CSS, and jQuery. Throughout the development process, I delved deep into JavaScript concepts, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming. By building this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience and honed my skills in front-end web development. I hope you enjoy playing Simon Game as much as I enjoyed creating it!

**Note:** For the best experience, use a modern web browser with support for HTML5 and JavaScript.
